# Write Your E-Mail HTML code Happily!
Let Gulp.js take care of your SASS and HTML and happy coding.

## Installation

### 1. Install `Gulp.js` Globally

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g gulp
```

### 2. Clone this Repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/erwaiyang/Easy-E-Mail-HTML-Coding.git
$ cd Easy-E-Mail-HTML-Coding/
```

### 3. npm install

```bash
$ npm install
```

### 4. start `Gulp` at root directory or `npm start`

```bash
$ npm start
```

or

```bash
$ gulp
```

## How to Use

### 1. Your HTML code

`./src/index.html`

### 2. Your SASS file

`./src/styles/main.scss`

Note: import all your SASS file in `main.scss`.

There is a `reset.css` file and I already have it imported.

### 3. Output

At `./build/index.html`.

All styles are injected into HTML elements; copy all lines in `./build/index.html`, that's all! :)
